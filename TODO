* rcre should be able to reload bashrc for all tmux sessions
* Either separate scripts or at least functions in separate files like in http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/282331/128174
* Also ask git (the cron job) for patches (staged and unstaged) and save each to a separate file wip-date-[un]staged.diff
* Learn Mail, make cron jobs send reports when they fail.
* Add Kindle highlights parsing to this repository
* Move vk_saver to this repository
* Script for automatically updating the dot-files and scripts from different places in the system(s) (run as an anacron job).
  - or hardlinks? Hardlinks have drawbacks though: if you stash, it gets stashed in the system as well.
* Reread how to apply a license to the code and ISC the code in this repo.
* bashrc should be in dotfiles, updated w/the same fetch script...
* gdbinit: dd should work with
  - cgraph_node* (call node->debug())
  - rtx (call debug_rtx (expr))
  - gimple tree (as before)
* Use submodules for vim plugins
* Add archbook files in a structured way (with all the filesystem structure, but with only a few files)
  - systemd scripts
  - /etc/fstab
* Re-structure this TODO (priority items vs. all others)
